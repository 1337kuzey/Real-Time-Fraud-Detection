## Overview

Fraud detection is crucial in various industries, especially in finance and e-commerce. This pipeline processes data in real-time to identify potentially fraudulent activities. It uses machine learning models to analyze incoming data and make predictions on-the-fly. The architecture is designed to handle high volumes of data while ensuring low latency.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Apache Kafka**: For real-time data streaming.
- **FastAPI**: To build the web API for model predictions.
- **XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM**: For machine learning models.
- **Prometheus**: For monitoring metrics.
- **Grafana**: For data visualization.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1337kuzey/Real-Time-Fraud-Detection.git
   cd Real-Time-Fraud-Detection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up Kafka**:
   Follow the [Kafka Quickstart](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) to set up your Kafka environment.

5. **Run the FastAPI application**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the API at `http://localhost:8000/docs`. This interface allows you to interact with the fraud detection models. 

### Making Predictions

To make predictions, send a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with the required data. Here‚Äôs an example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": { "feature1": value1, "feature2": value2 }}'
```

### Data Flow

The data flows through Kafka, where it is consumed by the FastAPI application. The application then processes the data using the trained machine learning models to predict whether the transaction is fraudulent.

## Architecture

The architecture of the Real-Time Fraud Detection pipeline consists of the following components:

- **Data Producer**: Sends transaction data to Kafka.
- **Kafka Broker**: Manages the data streams.
- **FastAPI Application**: Consumes data from Kafka and makes predictions.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Process the data and provide predictions.
- **Prometheus**: Collects metrics for monitoring.
- **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics and alerts.

## Monitoring

To monitor the application, Prometheus scrapes metrics from the FastAPI application. You can visualize these metrics in Grafana by creating dashboards. 

### Setting Up Prometheus

1. Create a `prometheus.yml` configuration file.
2. Add the FastAPI application as a target.
3. Start Prometheus using the configuration file.

### Setting Up Grafana

1. Install Grafana and start the server.
2. Add Prometheus as a data source.
3. Create dashboards to visualize metrics.
